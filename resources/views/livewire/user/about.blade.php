                <p>
                    Sarve Sukhantu Swaha was founded by Muskesh Ostwal, who tragically lost his father at a young age. This experience made him acutely aware of the immense hardship
                    families face after losing their primary breadwinner. Driven by a desire to help others avoid similar struggles, Muskesh Ostwal established Sarve Sukhantu Swaha to
                    provide comprehensive support to families who have suffered such a loss.
